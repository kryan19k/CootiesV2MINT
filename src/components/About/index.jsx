                                            The CootiesV2 is a collection of
                                            8,888 randomly generative NFT's
                                            living on the Flare network.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This means that each Cootie is a
                                            unique, one-of-a-kind token that can
                                            never be replicated or duplicated.
                                            They are also indestructible,
                                            meaning that once they are minted,
                                            they will exist forever on the Flare
                                            network.
                                        </p>

                                            The Cooties were created with the
                                            intention of being a fun and
                                            whimsical project that would bring
                                            attention to the Flare network and
                                            NFT technology. As such, they are
                                            not intended to have any intrinsic
                                            value. Instead, their value lies in
                                            their uniqueness and the fact that
                                            they are impossible to replicate.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Depending on the uniqueness of your
                                            NFT, determines the output of $COOT

                                            already be used as currency within
                                            the game to purchase items such as
                                            booster packs and card sleeves
